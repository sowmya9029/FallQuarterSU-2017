/*
 * Derived is really two parts: a Base part, and a Derived part. When C++ 
 * constructs derived objects, it does so in phases. First, the most-base class 
 * (at the top of the inheritance tree) is constructed first. Then each child 
 * class is constructed in order, until the most-child class (at the bottom of 
 * the inheritance tree) is constructed last.
 *
 * So when we instantiate an instance of Derived, first the Base portion of 
 * Derived is constructed (using the Base default constructor). Once the Base 
 * portion is finished, the Derived portion is constructed (using the Derived 
 * default constructor). At this point, there are no more derived classes, 
 * so we are done.
